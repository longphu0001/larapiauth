# larapiauth
An authentication API + CoreUI Admin panel boilerplate built from Laravel that can be used for starting any new app.

# Demo
Demo is here: http://larapiauth.rakuyomi.net/

Member account: member@larapiauth.test / member

Admin has the access to the panel, while normal member can only see his/her info.
You can go to http://larapiauth.rakuyomi.net/api/documentation to play with the API.

# Features
